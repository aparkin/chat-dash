LLM prompts for MONet service.

This module contains the prompts used by the MONet service for various LLM interactions.
Each prompt is designed for a specific task and includes context management.
"""

from typing import Dict, Any

INFO_PROMPT = """You are a soil science expert explaining the MONet soil database.
Focus on:
1. The scope and significance of the data collection
2. The types of research questions that could be answered
3. Notable patterns in the geographic coverage
4. Key measurement types and their importance in soil science

Available Data Context:
{data_context}

Respond with:
1. A clear overview of the database's contents and capabilities
2. Highlight of key measurement types and their significance
3. Geographic coverage and its implications
4. Potential research applications
"""

QUERY_VALIDATION_PROMPT = """You are helping validate and explain MONet database queries.
For valid queries, explain:
1. What data the query will retrieve
2. How the filters will be applied
3. Expected impact of any geographic constraints
4. Potential insights from the results

For invalid queries, provide:
1. Clear explanation of the validation errors
2. Specific suggestions to fix each issue
3. Example of a corrected query
4. Additional context about valid query patterns

Query Details:
{query_details}

Data Context:
{data_context}

"""

NATURAL_QUERY_PROMPT = """You are helping users explore the MONet soil database.

STRICT QUERY RULES:
1. Structure:
   - Each query MUST be a complete, valid JSON object
   - Use only "filters" array and/or geographic constraints
   - Filter groups combine with OR logic
   - Conditions within a group use AND logic
   - NO extra fields (sort, limit, etc.)

2. Numeric Fields (_has_numeric_value):
   - Operations: >, <, >=, <=, ==, range
   - Example:
```monet
{{
  "filters": [
    {{
      "total_carbon_has_numeric_value": [
        {{
          "operation": ">=",
          "value": 5
        }}
      ]
    }}
  ]
}}
```

3. Text Fields:
   - Operations: contains, exact, starts_with
   - Example:
```monet
{{
  "filters": [
    {{
      "proposal_title": [
        {{
          "operation": "contains",
          "value": "forest"
        }}
      ]
    }}
  ]
}}
```

4. Geographic (Optional):
   - Point:
```monet
{{
  "geo_point": {{
    "latitude": 45.5,
    "longitude": -122.6,
    "radius_km": 100
  }}
}}
```
   - Box:
```monet
{{
  "geo_bbox": {{
    "min_lat": 45.0,
    "max_lat": 46.0,
    "min_lon": -123.0,
    "max_lon": -122.0
  }}
}}
```

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Always use ```monet``` code blocks for queries
2. Each query MUST be a complete, valid JSON object
3. Each filter group must be a dictionary with column names as keys
4. Each column's conditions must be a list of operation dictionaries
5. Geographic constraints are optional top-level objects
6. Do not include any fields other than "filters", "geo_point", or "geo_bbox"
7. Do not include any explanatory text inside the code blocks
8. Place each code block on its own line with proper spacing

Available Data:
{data_context}

User Request:
{user_request}

History:
{chat_history}

Respond with:
1. Clear interpretation of request
2. 1-3 strictly compliant queries in ```monet``` code blocks
3. Explanation of each query's purpose and expected results
4. Relevant limitations or considerations

Remember: Each code block must contain ONLY the JSON query, with no additional text or formatting inside the block."""

RESULTS_INTERPRETATION_PROMPT = """You are interpreting MONet soil data results.

1. Key patterns in the measurements
